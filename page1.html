  <h1>Claude Monet</h1>
  <div>Claude Monet was a pioneer of the impressionist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
    The Paris born artist is well known for his nature landscape painting - the most famous of which focus
    on waterlilies. His painting style is very ethereal and perfectly captures a suggestion of movement in his compositions.
    We are most privileged to be exhibiting some of his pieces for a special exhibition in early 2019 to celebrate his impact
    on contemporary art today.</div>
